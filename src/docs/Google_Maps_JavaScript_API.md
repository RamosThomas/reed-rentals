# Usage and Billing

Begin every month with $200 USD of free use/credit. This equates to

[SKU: Dynamic Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage-and-billing#dynamic-maps)
200 USD / 0.007 USD per each request = 28571.428 free requests

The above is for maps being used at all in application.

[SKU: Dynamic Street View](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage-and-billing#dynamic-street-view) is more expensive, almost twice as much and less necessary. Other services also come with additional billing rates and are likely not needed. This includes a variety of services such as; directions, elevations, geocoding, etc.

The use of this service, without exceeding the **free** allowed allowance of $200 per month, is completely doable. The account that is opened for billing purposes, can put restrictions on usage.
